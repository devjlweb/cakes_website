Call me *Ishmael*. Some years ago–*never mind how long
precisely*–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving
off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.
