I"ß<p>If anyone knew how to bake a cake it was Joan; she made
the most special birthday cakes of anyone around town. From
her run down house, from inside the adorned walls, she made cakes
fit for royalty!</p>

<p>The cake was decorated exactly how we asked for. They accommodated for mine and my momâ€™s gluten-free dietary restriction. The cake tasted very good and was not overly sweet and it was on time.</p>
