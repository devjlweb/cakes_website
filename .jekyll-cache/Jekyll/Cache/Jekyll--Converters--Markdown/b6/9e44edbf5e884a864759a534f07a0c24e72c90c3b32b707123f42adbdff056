I"\<p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving
off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>

<p>The cake was decorated exactly how we asked for. They accommodated for mine and my mom’s gluten-free dietary restriction. The cake tasted very good and was not overly sweet and it was on time.</p>
